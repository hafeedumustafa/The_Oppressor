# The Oppressor
A game inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild and Genshin Impact, using core ideas to bring an open world full of wonders to life. A game built in the Unity game engine in version 2019.4.15f1, a stabilised and LTS version of Unity, so there will (likely) be no issues with the game engine itself, apart from graphic handling.
